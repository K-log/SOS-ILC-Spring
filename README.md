# SOS-ILC-Spring
My repository for my work on my SOS ILC in the Spring 2018.

Additions so far
---
- Setup a default rails app.
- Added a demo controller 
- Added two demo views, index and hello, along with routing to those views
  - Added global variables and page params to the hello view and cross view linking with redirection and a direct link.
- Setup a MySql database with a rails user along with permisions to access and change both the development and test databases I created but not root access.
- Learned how to construct migrations files and models but have not set those up in this rails app.
